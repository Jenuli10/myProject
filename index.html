        <h1> Books I like to read </h1>
        <hr>
        <hr>
        <p> I like to read fictional books, mystery books, and just some small books. I really like Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter, Roald Dahl's collection, Charlotte's Web, and more. But my favorite book is Geronimo Stilton. I have almost all the books in the Fantasy series. Now, I have 12 Geronimo books. I just need the last and 13th book, then, my collection is complete! Thea Stilton is next in line to complete. I have finished reading all the Geronimo, Thea Stilton and Harry Potter books more than thrice. Currently, I am reading Sherlock Holmes and Charlotte's Web. So far, Charlotte's Web is proving to be good and Sherlock Holmes has approved itself to me and has become one of my favorite books. So, to further explain the books, I shall extend the explanation a bit more so you, dear reader, can understand why I like these books so much, not only that, why I like reading so much. And, at the end, I shall give you a sneak peak at one of my other favorite hobbies, just a little read. So, here goes. First, Geronimo Stilton, It is about a mouse who unwillingly goes on adventures becoming more highly known amongst the Fantasy population each time. Thea Stilton, a mouse, younger sster of Geronimo, and she likes to go on"fur-raising" adventures unlike her brother. She helps 5 young mouselets to solve mysteries as well. My little Pony is known very far and very wide for it's stuff, like merchandise, and toys and cartoons and BOOKS. The My little pony books are mainly stories of the animated catoon series. Harry Potter, is a very interesting magical book, loads of readers, including me, have been enchanted by this book. Thanka a lot to J.K Rowling(Joanne Rowling) for making up this appealing series of fabulous stories. Sherlock Holmes, it is usually for people above 11, but I have made a teensy execption. I had begun reading it at 9 and I learned proper English at 7 years of age. Sherlock Holmes is a series of Mystery novels which as exciting as they are good. Thank you Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Next up, Charlotte's web, a book about a little girl named Fern and her pig Wilbur along with his best friend, a spider with the name Charlotte. Charlotte's a clever spider who helps Wilbur in any way she can. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a book consisting the most famous chocolatier in the world who gives out 5 gold tickets and the best behaved and disciplined child of the five gets a very special prize, The most famous chocolatier Mr Willy Wonka's colossal Chocolate Factory! Charlie and the great Glass Elevator just tells us that Willy Wonka and Charlie's family went to space, got younger, too much younger, older, too much older and that is the CRAZY Adventure. George's marvellous medicine, hmm...a boy who whips up a truly MARVELLOUS MEDICINE in order to cure his bitter grandma. Once he did that, he tries to make more of this magic drink but fails to get it right. In the end, his grandma shrunk down enough to never bother the family ANYMORE. The BFG, a book about a giant and a little girl who work together with the Queen of England to destroy the nasty giants. The fantastic Mr Fox is about how a clever fox dodges three revolting people to get food for his family and friends. Last but not least, the scariest, THE WITCHES!!!!A book about how a small boy who had heard tales of witches from his grandma arrives at a hotel where all the witches of England are gathered together to attend a meeting with the GRAND HIGH WITCH. In the end he and the other witches gets turned into a rat and the witches are gone.

    <p> First, let's start with Geronimo Stilton. Arshia Mittal has said "The Kingdom of Fantasy is the opening book of the Kingdom of Fantasy series, an extraordinary version of overwhelming fantasies, which is a mind-blogging feature of children's literature. The mythical creatures like witches, mermaids, dragons, pixies, gnomes, giants, and fairies, when comes in snout to snout to the not so fearless mouse, baffles the readers while putting them in deep contemplation about their existence. Are they an extinct species and a figment of our imagination, or do we actually come across such mythical and mystical kingdoms, or are these stories just narrated to our children to instill wings of imagination and creativity. 

This book, written in a very lucid language, with abundant images, stylized text, is also home to riddles, tongue twisters, and optical illusions. The graphical maps and invented details of the seven Kingdoms of Fantasy, make the readers wanting to visit and encounter the legendary beasts. 

Various fables have been beautifully interlocked to form this story, which is a favourite among the children. A common theme runs parallel throughout the book, i.e. the victory of good over evil. The story makes the readers believe that there is space for goodness always, and it is the inside that matters. One does not necessarily need to wear armor to be a knight. A knight is the one who is pure at heart, and willing to help others selflessly.", then we have Ibrahim Saasa saying "It isn't often that a book like 'THE KINGDOM OF FANTASY' comes along, but when it does, it sure is a book that must be read. A very interesting yet inspiring story, and an adventure worth reading by all ages. This book does not only make you enjoy every bit of word you read but it also has various sorts of different facts and information about all sorts of things as well as exciting short stories on kinds of different subjects. I would gladly recommend it to all the young readers out there. I am sure that they won't be disappointed." And how true that is! Lastly we have Raja Pratap commenting, "A VERY VERY VERY NICE BOOK OF GERONIMO STILTON WHAT A NICE BOOK THE KINGDOM OF FANTASY. I AM A DIE HARD FAN OF GERONIMO STILTON'S THE KINGDOM OF FANTASY AND WILL NEVER MISS ANY OF THE ADVENTURES IN KINGDOM OF FANTASY THIS IS MY PROMISE. THIS IS A REAL ADVENTURE." Let us see if you can keep that promise, shall we Raja? But I only have one more fantasy book to collect and BOOM! Collection complete. Then it is onwards to the normal Geronimo Stilton books. Moving on, I have decided to do only 2 more, because if you read so much, you'll get bored. Harry Potter reviews are next; Someone named Meydiana Rizki(sorry if I am being rude by saying someone) said, "I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the "magical" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.

Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!

Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as "guest stars" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word "earwax" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as "Maggie Smith cats", mumble "Shouldn't have said that," when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?

First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans." READER! DO NOT EAT BERTIE BOTT"S EVERY FLAVOUR BEANS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!(P.S. I haven't tried them but they are disgusting frm the youtubers' reviews) Next, Vo Tran (funny name, isn't it, reader?) he said, "Really good I like him as he was the main character who fight with Voldemort very greatly. I m an asian and India it so popular and I wish to meet u three
Ur performance and that quidditch match was so excited and also that ghost who guards that jail
And also serious black 
I also wish that producer has to make more films of them show dumbuledore, harmony, Ronald, serious black, Voldemort, Mrs. Weasley, Malfoy, and also HARRY POTTER.
💝💝💖💖💖💖
In ur first part that kingdom and that style you came here and the post letter that has been giving in your home again and again by an owl and that magic when haegret make that magical by giving tale that was so interesting and also that u r famous for ur that sign when Voldemort kill ur parent but u saved and Voldemort gave u some power of him that was very scared and shocking that Voldemort a simple boy who taught by dumbledore bitten him easily and I couldn't understand why another school helps them?
please give a reply to my question 
I m your big fan. I saw ur picture again and again" Sheesh, Vo Tran! We get it. And didn't you say that you were in Class 10? You NEED to improve your English, by that I mean your grammer, punctuation and spelling. Sheesh. Last one: Alexa Rose (Now THAT'S a nice name) said, "There has never been any other movie or movie series that has sent me on such an emotional roller coaster. The series truly fills in empty spots in your life and maybe even replaces ones. this could be either and good or bad thing, personally it was the most emotional part for me making it a little bit of both. i got attached to so many characters even the misunderstood ones. I fell in love with hogwarts and the characters in only a matter of days, i have never experienced anything like this in my life. when i was done with the series i truly felt sad and depressed that there were no more movies to watch. In order to boost my mood I had and still do watch the series over and over as many times as possible, to remind me of all the characters and hogwarts, my favorite place it self. the harry potter fandom has truly made me feel included and welcome. I feel so connected to the characters, it’s unreal. I cried for days straight knowing that I can’t go to hogwarts, marry draco malfoy, or be best friends with harry, harmonie, and ron. I had never felt so filled yet empty when i finished the series. You will also notice the mood and style change from and 2nd movie and the 3rd going on which was also very emotional for me( different producers, different styles) but just remember that it’ll end being okay! trust me! I’m not one to be a potter head or to be obsessed with things like this but, harry potter its truly different!". THANKS ALEXA!!!!!! last book; Sherlock Holmes. First person; John Kooz (HEEHEEHHHEHHEHE, FUNNY NAME NOT THE JOHN...the Koooooooozzzzz) says: As someone whom is way more than a Sherlock Holmes aficionado (I have read all 4 novels and all 56 short stories by Doyle), all I can say is Downey was exceptional; Ritchie’s directing was spot on; and Jude Law makes a superb Watson.

That said, the true question is does it compare to BBC’s modernized Sherlock?  In my opinion, they’re incomparable.  The tv series provides room for characters to evolve, and they do. Plus, it takes place in modern London.  Although his portrayal is so uniquely peculiar, I’d say Cumberbatch’s performance is as good and maybe even slightly better than Downey’s, but one must take into account that Downey had to craft a British accent which was a natural dialect for Cumberbatch.  The BBC Ms. Hudson was perfectly cast and well-played, another dimensional development to the TV series.  But I believe I prefer Jude Law as Watson to Martin Freeman. Loved them both. Kudos to Ritchie.

Conclusively, as a movie, the Ritchie direction was incredible and Downey’s action Sherlock Holmes is riveting. Next, I have a person named Yusufpasha Peerjade, saying: Opening on Christmas Day, Sherlock Holmes showed itself to be worthy as a blockbuster hit. To be frank, I came with high expectations that the movie would be terrible. But I was proved wrong. 
Sherlock Holmes seems to be like the new James Bond: gritty, hardcore and always ready for a good fight. He is not only intellectually sophisticated but also quite a brawler. Dr. Watson his side kick who is loyal friend is always there to save his dear partner from harm's way. Irene plays the notorious thief and lover of Mr. Holmes. She is a wily character who keeps the reader guessing her motives.
The cinematography of the movie was special because it showed parts of the film as Holmes' future logical deductions. The movie also used the tradition method of explaining the Sherlock Holmes deductions after given the facts and clues.
Sherlock Holmes' evil nemesis Lord Blackwood plays his part well. There were many humorous antics displays of ingenious traps. The other minor characters also added to the crude humor and laughter.
Overall, this movie deserves to be watched. It comes with sparkles of spontaneity and fun. And it may even leave you wanting for a sequel! Give it a try! Final Verdict: Entertaining, Sophisticated, Gritty - A New Breed of Sherlock Holmes. Last, Aditya Surve said: Sherlock Holmes is an outstanding period mystery action film. Based on the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The film is greatly directed by Guy Ritchie and excellently written by Michael Robert Johnson,
Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg.

The film has an outstanding mysterious gripping story by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert
Johnson. I love this Sherlock Holmes' version of stylish and darkest.

Robert Downey Jr. And Jude Law are outstandingly played main roles with Michel McAdam as 
Irene Adler and Mark Strong also outstandingly played the role of Lord Henry Blackwood.

The film has stylish and perfect music by Hans Zimmer.

I love ❤️ this film.  I love ❤️ These new versions of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. Thank you for reading the reviews reader. Not that you had a choice, though...</p>

   <section id="insparation"> 
     <p> Elisabetta Dami, quotes, "'My father was my mentor,' she says, her voice resonating with pride. 'He loved books and inspired me to write and read.' Gnawed upon by the travel bug during her tours around the world with her father, the Italian quickly developed a thirst for adventure."' 
       JK Rowling got her inspration from The Elephant House cafe. 
The Elephant House cafe in Edinburgh has long been known as a source of inspiration for Rowling, who “sat writing much of her early novels in the back room overlooking Edinburgh Castle”, according to the cafe's website, and a sign outside the store claiming to be the “birthplace” of Harry Potter.
       Sherlock Holmes was created by Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
Inspiration of Sherlock Holmes,
Arthur Conan Doyle met Bell in 1877, and served as his clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Doyle later went on to write a series of popular stories featuring the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, who Doyle stated was loosely based on Bell and his observant ways.
       E.B White got her inspartion to write Charlotte's web from an experience...One day, White spotted a spider spinning an egg sac in his barn in Maine. This encounter provided the inspiration for what is perhaps his most beloved work, Charlotte's Web (1952), about the friendship between a spider named Charlotte and Wilbur the pig.
       Roald Dahl...hmm.I wonder....Dahl's childhood love of sweets is exhibited in many of his books including 'The Witches' and 'The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me. ... Apart from his childhood memories, Dahl also got the inspiration to write his children's books from the bedtime stories he would make up for his children of a night time.
